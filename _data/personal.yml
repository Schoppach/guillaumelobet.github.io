intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I am a post-doc researcher at the [Université de Liège](http://www.ulg.ac.be), in [Belgium](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Belgium), in the Plant Physiology lab of Pr. Claire Perilleux.    
      
    The aim of my current project is to quantify the growth and developmental regulations (allometry) between the root and the shoot in the model plant maize (*Zea mays*). The project focuses on the events occurring before and after the floral transition. As this stage occurs late in the plant development, the size of the different organs, in particular that of the root system, hinder their observation and analysis. A direct consequence of such constraints is that very little information about the root system development exist at these stages.        
      
    I also love to develop image analysisand phenotyping tools to help researchers in their scientific workflow. And when I am not implementing image analysis tools, I often play with plant models.  
      
      
    Apart from my daily research activity, I love to reference [plant image analysis software](http://www.plant-image-analysis.org) and [funny plant genes names](http://www.toplessninja.tumblr.com).
