If you have ever analysed root system images, you might now the unspoken truth: it requires a great deal of time and efforts! Either you work with an automated tracing software (such as [EZ-Rhizo]() or [RootSystemAnalyzer]()) and as soon as the root systems are getting old (more than 10 days) you'll need to spend quite some time correcting the detection; or you work with a semi-automated tool (such as [SmartRoot]() or [RootNav]()) and you'll have to go through every single image to trace the roots. The **good thing** is that you know you'll get great data out of it! Architectural data are extremely rich and can be analysed in multiple ways. However, the **downside of the story** is that you will use only a fraction of the data and the rest will be lost. This is what the [Root System Markup Language]() is about.
